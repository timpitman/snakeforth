# SnakeForth: a forth interpreter in python

SnakeForth is a simple forth interpreter implemented in Python, created as an exercise to learn forth.

I've always been interested in the minimalism of the forth programming language, and its use in bootstrapping embedded systems. Creating a simple implementation in Python seemed like a great way to learn!
